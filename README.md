Home Page of Twitter cloned using ReactJS and pure CSS:

  - Layout and most of the visual effects are implemented
  - Redux / Redux-thunk are used to simulate the calls to API by getting defined dummy data.
  - Is not responsive yet
  - Float menus are not implemented yet

I may update and finish it when I have time.
