As I can't show the code of my real projects, I cloned the Home Page of Twitter in about 2 days using ReactJS and pure CSS.

Feel free to check the code and use it if you like. Note that the CSS and some parts can (should) be optimized. 

I may optimize it and finish it when I have time.

  - Layout and most of the visual effects are implemented
  - Redux / Redux-thunk are used to simulate the calls to API by getting defined dummy data.
  - Is not responsive yet
  - Float menus are not implemented yet
